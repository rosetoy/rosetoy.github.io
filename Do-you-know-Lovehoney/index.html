        <p>Lovehoney is a significant player in the world of sex toys and adult products and has become one of the most successful companies in this industry since it was founded in 2002. The brand has been very successful online and marketing itself as a fun and friendly brand that doesn’t take itself too seriously. Lovehoney owner Richard Longhurst is no stranger to the sex industry; he started working for an adult magazine when he was 17 years old! His background gave him insight into what his customers wanted from a sex toy retailer. The company’s focus on customer service is reflected in its marketing efforts and promotions—such as its annual “Lovehoney” awards ceremony (which aims to recognize excellence among retailers) and its “100 Days of Lovin’” campaign (which provides discounts on select items). For people who don’t feel comfortable buying sex toys or other adult products in person—or who live somewhere where such products are illegal—the discreet packaging offered by Lovehoney is also an excellent option.</p>
<h2 id="Lovehoney-has-achieved-massive-success-as-a-retailer-of-sex-toys-and-other-items-related-to-sexual-health-and-pleasure"><a href="#Lovehoney-has-achieved-massive-success-as-a-retailer-of-sex-toys-and-other-items-related-to-sexual-health-and-pleasure" class="headerlink" title="Lovehoney has achieved massive success as a retailer of sex toys and other items related to sexual health and pleasure."></a>Lovehoney has achieved massive success as a retailer of sex toys and other items related to sexual health and pleasure.</h2><p>Lovehoney, the online adult retailer, and manufacturer, has achieved massive success as a retailer of sex toys and other items related to sexual health and pleasure. Since its founding in 2002, Lovehoney has grown into one of the most successful companies in this industry.</p>
<p>Lovehoney offers a wide variety of products, including lingerie and clothing like corsets; lubricants; bondage equipment like handcuffs; condoms; adult games; books about sex (both fiction and non-fiction); DVDs featuring both straight couples as well as same-sex couples having sex together; vibrators with different types of motors (rotating shafts versus vibrating pads) that can stimulate different parts of your body depending on where you place them against your skin; edible underwear made out of chocolate or other edible substances such as gummy bears! The selection is so vast that it’s difficult to know where to start when shopping at Love Honey but don’t worry - there are plenty more options beyond what I’ve listed here!</p>
<h2 id="Lovehoney’s-offerings-cover-all-the-different-aspects-of-sexuality-including-heterosexual-homosexual-bisexual-transgender-and-other-orientations-as-well-as-all-genders"><a href="#Lovehoney’s-offerings-cover-all-the-different-aspects-of-sexuality-including-heterosexual-homosexual-bisexual-transgender-and-other-orientations-as-well-as-all-genders" class="headerlink" title="Lovehoney’s offerings cover all the different aspects of sexuality, including heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, transgender, and other orientations, as well as all genders."></a>Lovehoney’s offerings cover all the different aspects of sexuality, including heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, transgender, and other orientations, as well as all genders.</h2><p>Lovehoney’s offerings cover all the different aspects of sexuality, including heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, transgender, and other orientations, as well as all genders. The company offers toys for everyone—so no matter what your sexual orientation is or how you identify yourself (or if you want to explore a new identity), Lovehoney will have something that suits your needs.</p>
<p>The open-mindedness at Lovehoney isn’t just reflected in its diverse products; it also extends to how they are marketed. When customers buy a product from the site, they can choose whether they want it shipped with plain brown packaging. If they decide not to receive any external labeling on their package (not even disclosing who sent it), it will be delivered without indicating that sex toys were purchased inside!</p>

The company has a cheeky, humorous edge to its marketing that makes it feel approachable. Lovehoney is quirky in an exciting way—you can tell that the company doesn’t take itself too seriously.</p>
<p>The brand’s advertising often includes funny voiceovers or bold typography that makes you smile no matter how often you see it (which is likely many). This kind of branding works well for Lovehoney because of how quickly they can get their products into your hands without compromising on quality standards or customer service.</p>

Founded by Richard Longhurst in 2006, the company has grown to over 200 employees and has taken on a name that’s become synonymous with its products.</p>
<p>In his interview with Cosmopolitan UK, Longhurst explained how he got into the industry: “I started as an actor and worked on many TV shows such as Casualty, Heartbeat, and Holby City.” He continued: “It was during this period that I realized that there was a gap in online shopping for sex toys.”</p>

Richard Longhurst had been one of those retailers, running his sex shop in London before moving into online retail. His background gave him insight into what his customers wanted from a sex toy retailer.</p>
<p>He knew that they wanted discretion and privacy when making their purchases. He also knew that they wished for quality products with good reviews—but it was difficult for people to find high-quality toys and reliable reviews on their own without wasting time searching through hundreds of mediocre options first.</p>

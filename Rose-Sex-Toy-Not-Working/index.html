        <p>I’m sorry to hear that your sex toy isn’t working! I am sure that there are many reasons why this could happen. You should try charging the sex toy for longer than what it says on the package or website. If you still don’t get any results, you can try a different charger and see if it works. If none of those work, you should contact customer support because there could be an issue with the toy or the charger itself.</p>
<h2 id="How-do-you-charge-the-sex-toy"><a href="#How-do-you-charge-the-sex-toy" class="headerlink" title="How do you charge the sex toy?"></a>How do you charge the sex toy?</h2><ul>
<li><p>Plug the charger into the base of your sex toy, and plug the other end into a power outlet.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Wait for the light on the charger to turn from red to green—this will indicate that it’s fully charged and ready to use!</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you don’t see a green light after five hours, check that all parts of your cord are fully plugged in and functional.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="For-how-long-should-you-charge-the-sex-toy"><a href="#For-how-long-should-you-charge-the-sex-toy" class="headerlink" title="For how long should you charge the sex toy?"></a>For how long should you charge the sex toy?</h2><p>Charging your sex toy for longer than recommended can damage the battery. The charging time varies depending on the type of sex toy you’re using. Most vibrators should be charged for at least 2 hours, but some can take up to 8 hours to fully charge. If you leave a charging device plugged in overnight or longer, it will have a hard time holding a charge and may not work properly when you use it next time.</p>
<h2 id="Is-there-a-light-that-tells-you-when-it-is-charged"><a href="#Is-there-a-light-that-tells-you-when-it-is-charged" class="headerlink" title="Is there a light that tells you when it is charged?"></a>Is there a light that tells you when it is charged?</h2><p>If the light is on, you know it’s charging. If the light is off, then you need to charge it.</p>
<p>If your toy has a light and it’s not turning on when you plug it in, there may be something wrong with your charger or charging port. If this happens, we recommend taking the toy in for service at an authorized retailer (like our store!) instead of trying to fix it yourself.</p>
<h2 id="Did-you-check-the-charger-to-see-if-it-is-working"><a href="#Did-you-check-the-charger-to-see-if-it-is-working" class="headerlink" title="Did you check the charger to see if it is working?"></a>Did you check the charger to see if it is working?</h2><p>Before you do anything else, check the charger to see if it works. If there is no light, it is not charging, and you will need to replace the power adapter. If there is a light and your vibrator is not vibrating, you may have a broken battery or switch on your toy.</p>
<h2 id="Did-you-try-charging-it-with-different-chargers"><a href="#Did-you-try-charging-it-with-different-chargers" class="headerlink" title="Did you try charging it with different chargers?"></a>Did you try charging it with different chargers?</h2><ul>
<li><p>If your charger is not working, it might be the charger itself. Try a new charger to see if that fixes the problem.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you’re already charging with a different charger and it’s still not working, you may have a problem with the toy itself. Check out our troubleshooting guide below!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Did-you-try-cleaning-it-to-see-if-there-is-something-stuck-in-the-toy-that-would-prevent-it-from-working"><a href="#Did-you-try-cleaning-it-to-see-if-there-is-something-stuck-in-the-toy-that-would-prevent-it-from-working" class="headerlink" title="Did you try cleaning it to see if there is something stuck in the toy that would prevent it from working?"></a>Did you try cleaning it to see if there is something stuck in the toy that would prevent it from working?</h2><ul>
<li><p>Clean your toy. You can use a soft cloth to clean the surface of your sex toy, but avoid using soap or alcohol on it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t submerge it in water. Your toys are not waterproof and shouldn’t be used submerged in water (yes, we know—this is an obvious one).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t use any abrasive cleaners. Avoid harsh detergents or soaps on your toy since these cleaners may degrade the material over time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t leave it in direct sunlight for long periods, as this will also affect how quickly your toy wears out over time!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Did-you-just-get-the-toy-and-haven’t-used-it-before-could-there-be-an-issue-with-the-toy-itself"><a href="#Did-you-just-get-the-toy-and-haven’t-used-it-before-could-there-be-an-issue-with-the-toy-itself" class="headerlink" title="Did you just get the toy and haven’t used it before, could there be an issue with the toy itself?"></a>Did you just get the toy and haven’t used it before, could there be an issue with the toy itself?</h2><p>If you just got the toy and haven’t used it before, could there be an issue with the toy itself? The best thing to do is contact customer support. They are available 24/7 to help troubleshoot any problems you might have.</p>
<h2 id="You-should-call-customer-support-for-help"><a href="#You-should-call-customer-support-for-help" class="headerlink" title="You should call customer support for help."></a>You should call customer support for help.</h2><p>If you are having trouble with your rose sex toy, we recommend you call customer support for help. They will be able to troubleshoot the issue and determine if it is a problem with the toy itself or something else. In many cases, they can also help you figure out how to fix the problem yourself. If this happens, don’t hesitate to call and ask them for advice on how to fix it!</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Hopefully, you have found the solution to your problem and can enjoy your toy once again. If not, it’s time to call customer support! With so many companies out there, it can be hard to tell which one offers the best service. But rest assured that they all offer a lifetime warranty on their products, so even if they don’t fix yours right away, at least you know it’ll get fixed eventually</p>
